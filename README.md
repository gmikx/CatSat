# CatSat
## Hi!
### Welcome to the **CatSat team** (CanSat competition) repo for development - software for our CanSat, the ground station, as well as a program for processing the images collected during the flight.

### Cats also can fly! :cat::stars:

### We combined 2 datasets - one available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahmoudreda55/satellite-image-classification?resource=download) and the other is [EuroSAT](https://madm.dfki.de/files/sentinel/EuroSAT.zip). 
### We had to resize and preprocess the images from Kaggle since their size is 128x128, not 64x64 (as with EuroSat). Our dataset is available [HERE](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/5cfea9pfxti8pv3/dataset.zip?dl=0).

### We decided to use ***Convolutional Neural Networks***, to recognize the type of terrain from *almost*-satellite images, and thus create a map of the area over which our CanSat will fly. To achieve this goal, we used the Python language and Tensorflow libraries
